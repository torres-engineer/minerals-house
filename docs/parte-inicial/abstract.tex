\tituloPretextual{Abstract}

This project presents ``Minerals' House'', an educational game designed to improve literacy regarding geology in everyday life. The general public often lacks awareness regarding the geological origin of materials that constitute everyday objects, such as mobile phones or household appliances. The main goal is to make the connection between mineral resources and final products visible, using a discovery-based learning approach and gamification.

Technically, the game employs an innovative hybrid architecture, with
core logic implemented in the Odin language and compiled to
WebAssembly (WASM), allowing native execution within a web browser.
The graphical interface combines Canvas rendering with semantic HTML
elements for accessibility.

The prototype allows users to explore familiar settings (such as a
house), identify objects, and consult the minerals associated with
their manufacturing. To consolidate learning, the system includes
formative assessment quizzes at the end of each level. The results
demonstrate that it is possible to create robust and accessible
educational tools that bridge the gap between abstract scientific
concepts and the tangible reality of students.
